## Introduction

Following the [initial launch of QRyptshare](/posts/qryptshare-qr-code-generator/), my goal has always been to provide a privacy-first alternative to the ad-ridden QR generators cluttering the web.

Today, I'm releasing **QRyptshare v1.1.0**. This update focuses on **customization** and **flexibility**, allowing you to create professional-looking QR codes that match your brand or aesthetic—all while keeping the core promise of zero server-side data processing.

## 🎨 What's New in v1.1.0?

The biggest feedback from v1.0.0 was that while functional, standard black-and-white QR codes can look a bit "raw." This update introduces a completely client-side styling engine.

### 1. Custom Styling & Frames
You can now modify the visual appearance of your QR codes directly in the browser:
* **Custom Colors:** Change the foreground line color (the "data" part) while ensuring the background remains white for maximum scanner compatibility.
* **Quiet Zone Control:** Adjust the safety margin around the code.
* **Border Styling:** Add a custom frame, adjust thickness, and round the corners.

### 2. Expanded Export Formats
The download engine has been rewritten to support multiple formats. Previously locked to PNG, you can now export as:
* **PNG** (Lossless, transparent capable)
* **JPG** (Compressed, smaller file size)
* **WebP** (Modern web standard)

### 3. Under the Hood: Canvas Manipulation
To achieve these styles without sending data to a server, we utilized the HTML5 Canvas API. The raw SVG generated by `react-qr-code` is serialized, drawn onto a temporary canvas, and then "framed" using composite operations to draw borders and round corners dynamically before export.

## 🛠️ Updated Tech Stack & Deployment

The architecture remains lean, utilizing **Next.js 14** and **Docker** on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**.

### Docker Optimization (v1.1.0)
We've optimized the `Dockerfile` to handle build arguments better, ensuring that development dependencies like `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` are correctly installed during the build phase, even in production environments.

If you are self-hosting, the update process is seamless:

```bash
cd QRyptshare
git pull
# Force a rebuild to pick up the new styling engine dependencies
docker-compose up -d --build
````

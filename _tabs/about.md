# About Me

Welcome to **SYNTAX**. This isn't a textbook—it’s a workspace. I share **S**imple **Y**et **N**ecessary **T**ips And e**X**periments in technology, covering everything from the code snippets you need today to the deep-dive projects you might try tomorrow.

## 👋 Hi, I'm Alfredo Sanchez

I'm an IT professional based in the Philippines, working extensively in systems, networks, software, and shipboard IoT technology. I enjoy building practical systems that solve real operational problems — from ERP modules to GPS tracking, CCTV integrations, solar-powered vessel systems, and various in-house applications.

My focus areas include:

* 🚢 **Maritime technology** – GPS, AIS, Starlink integration, shipboard IoT
* 🖥️ **Systems & Network Administration** – firewalls, servers, structured networks
* 🛠️ **Software Development** – ERP, REST APIs, monitoring dashboards
* ⚡ **Solar & Power Systems** – inverters, battery setups, shipwide solar projects
* 📡 **Connectivity Solutions** – Starlink deployment for vessels & remote sites

I handle technical operations, infrastructure, and system development for our company. This includes:

* Designing and maintaining ship-to-shore communication systems
* Overseeing hardware, networking, and system verifications
* Building and maintaining in-house software and ERP modules
* Ensuring our fleets stay connected and monitored across the Philippines
* Managing deployments like servers, CCTVs, solar power systems, and kiosks

I also enjoy researching new tools, optimizing workflows, and integrating emerging tech to improve operational efficiency.
